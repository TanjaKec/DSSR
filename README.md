Slides for: Data Scienca Storry Telling with [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)

In this workshop, we will use [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) language to turn statistics within the data into a story that people can understand and use to solve problems that are of concern to them or project ideas that are potentially life changing. Why [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)? Because [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is the most sophisticated data analysis programming language, quickly becoming the tool of choice for many data scientists, as it enables easy experimentation and exploration of data, reflecting and mirroring the way in which you consider a particular problem. [klikR](http://klikr.rbind.io/) amalgamates the learning of important and desirable skills of XXI century kids: code writing for statistical modelling and visualisation and data reporting in a reproducible manner. Through a series of demonstrations and hands on exercises you will learn some of the fundamental concepts of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and you will get to know how to use the tools needed in a typical data science project. You will be introduced to graphical and numerical techniques for exploring the information concealed within a dataset. After you develop an understanding of your data you will use [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)â€™s reproducible and interactive approach to knit this into a tight and concise narrative and of course, present your story by creating reproducible [R-Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) documents and [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) Web Apps.
